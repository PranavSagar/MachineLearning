# Machine Learning
## Logistic Regression
- It is use to predict the possibility of a model  
- We have to provide a set of data to make our model learn .
>This model, which is a very simple model just a linear combination of multiplying the observed data variables by associated parameters just summing them up, mapping that to a variable Zi and then running that through a Sigmoid function. This is a very classic model is called __logistic regression__.

- Without data set machine learning wouldn't work
- This is a very simple model with linear predictive model.
- lets assume that there is n numbers of data for every X set  
so we will take single set of Xnth term and multiply each and every term of xnth terms with corresponding parameter and and we will add a additional constant that we called 'bias'.

## Sigmoid Function
- We can use this fuction to predict the possibilities of a certain event to be happen in a model.
- Sigmoid function is a way for us to convert predictions about the outcome of a given model into a probabilistic perspective.
